Solution — Exercise 4: Mediator agent with AgentTool
======================================================

A `mediator` LlmAgent that wraps two specialists as AgentTools:

  • buyer_specialist  — reports the buyer's budget ceiling
  • seller_specialist — calls the inventory MCP server for the seller's floor

The mediator's instruction tells it to call both, then propose a midpoint.
The mediator's LLM decides *when* to call each specialist; we don't wire
the calls explicitly.

Hierarchical delegation: parent LLM decides → child LLM executes → parent
synthesizes. Three LLM calls per user question (one mediator + two specialists).

To demo:

    adk web d2_adk_multiagents/solution/ex04_mediator_agent/

    Pick `mediator`, send: "What's a fair price for 742 Evergreen Terrace?"

    Watch the events panel — you'll see two tool calls (buyer_specialist,
    seller_specialist) plus the mediator's synthesis.
