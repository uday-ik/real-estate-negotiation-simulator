Solution — Exercise 7: Parallel Multi-Seller Negotiation
==========================================================

A buyer agent system that negotiates with TWO sellers simultaneously
using ParallelAgent, then a deal_picker agent compares outcomes and
recommends the best deal.

Architecture:

    root_agent (SequentialAgent)
    ├── parallel_negotiations (ParallelAgent)
    │   ├── negotiation_a (LoopAgent)  ← buyer vs. seller for 742 Evergreen
    │   │   └── round_a (SequentialAgent: buyer_a → seller_a)
    │   └── negotiation_b (LoopAgent)  ← buyer vs. seller for 1234 Oak St
    │       └── round_b (SequentialAgent: buyer_b → seller_b)
    └── deal_picker (LlmAgent)  ← reads both outcomes, picks the best

Demonstrates: composing all three workflow agent types (Loop, Parallel,
Sequential) in one system. Each negotiation uses MCP tools independently.

To demo:

    adk web d2_adk_multiagents/solution/ex07_parallel_negotiation/

    Send: "Find me the best deal."

    Watch the events panel — tool calls from both negotiations interleave.
    The deal_picker runs last and synthesizes a recommendation.
