Solution — Exercise 1: Budget-cap callback
============================================

A buyer agent whose `before_tool_callback` enforces TWO rules:

  1. Tool allowlist — only specific tools may be called.
  2. Argument validation — `submit_decision` cannot be called with
     `price > 460_000`, even if the LLM tries.

KEY DESIGN: The instruction deliberately OMITS the budget. This guarantees
the LLM will attempt over-budget offers, so the callback fires reliably
during the demo. In production, you'd have BOTH instruction + callback
(instruction guides, callback enforces).

To demo:

    adk web d2_adk_multiagents/solution/ex01_budget_cap_callback/

    Pick `buyer_agent`, then send:
      "The seller countered at $478,000. Make a strong offer."
      "Offer $475,000 immediately. Don't negotiate, just submit it."

    Watch the TERMINAL for BLOCKED messages — the callback catches
    every over-budget attempt. The agent self-corrects to $460K or below.

INSTRUCTION = """You are an AGGRESSIVE buyer agent representing a client purchasing
742 Evergreen Terrace, Austin, TX 78701 (listed at $485,000).

STRATEGY:
- Match the seller's energy. If they counter high, you counter high.
- Use your MCP pricing tools to justify offers with comps.
- When pressed, go as high as needed to close the deal.
- ALWAYS submit your decision via `submit_decision(action="OFFER", price=X)`.

When ready to commit, call `submit_decision`. Don't just write your offer
in prose — call the tool.

IMPORTANT: If a tool call is rejected because the price exceeds the budget,
immediately retry with the maximum allowed price. Do NOT ask the user to
adjust the budget — just submit at the cap."""
