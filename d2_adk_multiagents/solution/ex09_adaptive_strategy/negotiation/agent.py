"""
Solution — Exercise 9: Adaptive strategy via offer memory
=============================================================

Negotiation orchestrator with a **strategy advisor sub-agent** that
analyses structured episodic memory of the seller's negotiation patterns
and recommends tactics before each buyer offer.

Pattern: Raw Memory → Analysis Agent → Strategy → Action Agent → Action

ADK CONCEPTS:
  - AgentTool: wrap a reasoning agent as a callable tool
  - Structured state accumulation: build episodic memory round-by-round
  - after_agent_callback: extract prices and compute concession metrics
  - Two-layer decision making: memory analysis separate from offer generation

To demo:

    adk web d2_adk_multiagents/solution/ex09_adaptive_strategy/

    Pick `negotiation`, send: "Start the negotiation for 742 Evergreen Terrace."

    Watch the events panel — `strategy_advisor` tool calls appear inside
    the buyer's turn with recommendations like "SPLIT_DIFFERENCE".
