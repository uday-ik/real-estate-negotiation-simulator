Solution — Exercise 2: Stuck-detection orchestrator
=====================================================

Negotiation orchestrator that exits early when the negotiation stalls.

Three exit conditions, in priority order:
  1. Seller submits action='ACCEPT'  →  deal reached, escalate
  2. Three consecutive rounds with <$1,000 price movement  →  stalled, escalate
  3. max_iterations=5 reached         →  hard cap

The stall check fires AFTER the seller responds, AFTER acceptance is checked.
So a healthy negotiation that closes at round 3 still exits via ACCEPT,
not via the stall check.

To demo:

    # 1. Healthy run (default — buyer max $460K, seller floor $445K, ZOPA exists):
    adk web d2_adk_multiagents/solution/ex02_stuck_detection/
    Pick `negotiation` and send: "Start the negotiation."
    Expect: ACCEPT around round 2-3.

    # 2. Stalled run — set STALL_DEMO=true to drop buyer budget to $440K:
    #    $env:STALL_DEMO = "true"
    #    adk web d2_adk_multiagents/solution/ex02_stuck_detection/
    #    Expect: stall detected at round 3-4, NOT round 5.
