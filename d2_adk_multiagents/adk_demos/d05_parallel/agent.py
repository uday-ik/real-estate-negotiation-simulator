Demo 05 — ParallelAgent
=========================
Three sub-agents run concurrently, each writing to a different state key.
Useful for fan-out research — gathering multiple independent signals.

ADK CONCEPTS:
  - ParallelAgent: runs all children concurrently (not sequentially)
  - Each child writes to its own output_key — no conflicts
  - All results land in session state for a downstream agent to consume

Run:
