"""
Demo 03 — Sessions and State
==============================
LlmAgent that uses ToolContext to read/write session state across turns.
State persists within a session, letting the agent remember offer history.

ADK CONCEPTS:
  - ToolContext: injected into tools automatically by ADK
  - State scoping: "user:" prefix persists across sessions for the same user
  - Session state: tools can read/write shared state that the agent sees

Run:
