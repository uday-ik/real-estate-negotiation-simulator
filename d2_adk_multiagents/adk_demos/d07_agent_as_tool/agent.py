"""
Demo 07 — Agent-as-Tool (AgentTool)
=====================================
Wrap an entire agent and present it as a callable tool to another agent.
The coordinator calls the valuator "tool" when it needs a valuation —
the valuator is a full LlmAgent, but the coordinator sees it as a function.

ADK CONCEPTS:
  - AgentTool: wraps an LlmAgent so it looks like a regular tool
  - Hierarchical delegation: coordinator controls when to call the specialist
  - Unlike sub_agents (full delegation), AgentTool returns results to the caller
