"""
Demo 04 — SequentialAgent
==========================
Three sub-agents chained in declaration order.  Each writes to session
state via output_key; the next agent reads it via {placeholder} syntax.

Pipeline:  market_brief  →  offer_drafter  →  message_polisher

ADK CONCEPTS:
  - SequentialAgent: runs children in order, stops when the last finishes
  - output_key: each agent writes its output to a named state key
  - {state_key} in instructions: agents read prior outputs from state

Run:
