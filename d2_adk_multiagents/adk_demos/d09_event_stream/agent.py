"""
Demo 09 — ADK Event Stream
============================
An agent with tools that demonstrates the ADK event stream — the sequence
of Events emitted by Runner.run_async(). Every model call and tool call
produces an Event with content, actions, and metadata.

This demo prints all events to the terminal so you can see:
  - Which agent authored each event
  - Tool call requests and tool results as they happen
  - State deltas attached to events
  - The final response marker

ADK CONCEPTS:
  - Event: the unit of output from Runner.run_async()
  - event.author: which agent produced this event
  - event.content.parts: text, function_call, or function_response
  - event.actions: state_delta, escalate, transfer_to_agent
  - event.is_final_response(): marks the last text output
  - ToolContext state writes appear as state deltas in events

Run:
    adk web d2_adk_multiagents/adk_demos/d09_event_stream/

Note: The event details are visible in the adk web UI's "Events" panel
on the right side. This agent also prints events to the terminal for
instructor walkthroughs.
