"""
Negotiation Orchestrator — Idiomatic ADK
==========================================
LoopAgent wrapping a SequentialAgent (buyer → seller) to run multi-round
negotiation with real MCP tools. The buyer calls pricing tools before each
offer; the seller calls pricing + inventory tools (including the secret
floor price) before each counter.

Demonstrates: LoopAgent, SequentialAgent, MCPToolset, output_key state
passing, after_agent_callback with escalation, before_tool_callback
allowlists, information asymmetry.
