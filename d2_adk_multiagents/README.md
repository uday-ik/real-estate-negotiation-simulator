# Demo 2 — ADK Multi-Agents & A2A Protocol (`d2_adk_multiagents`)

**Requires:** `OPENAI_API_KEY` set as an environment variable

This module teaches Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) from first principles, then shows how agents communicate over the A2A protocol.

## The ADK Web UI

When you run `adk web`, a browser UI opens at `http://localhost:8000`. Here's what each element does:

### Top bar

| Element | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| **Agent dropdown** (top-left) | Pick which agent to chat with. Each subfolder with `__init__.py` + `agent.py` appears here |
| **Session dropdown** | Shows current session ID. Each session has its own conversation history and state |
| **New Session** button | Start a fresh conversation (clears history and state) |
| **Streaming** toggle (top-right) | When on, responses stream token by token. When off, you get the full response at once |

### Tab bar (below top bar)

| Tab | What it shows |
|-----|---------------|
| **Events** | The conversation flow: user messages, agent responses, tool call badges (⚡ = called, ✓ = completed). This is the main view |
| **Traces** | OpenTelemetry-style trace spans for each turn — useful for debugging latency |
| **Info** | The agent's resolved config: model, system instruction, discovered tools with full JSON schemas |
| **State** | Current session state dict — shows all keys written by `output_key` or `ToolContext.state` |
| **Artifacts** | Any artifacts saved during the session (binary blobs, generated files) |
| **Evals** | Agent evaluation runs (not used in this project) |

### Left panel (event inspector)

Click any event number in the conversation to see its raw details:
- **Event N of M** — navigate through all internal events (includes MCP handshake, tool calls, LLM requests, state deltas)
- Shows the full event payload: `author`, `content.parts`, `actions.stateDelta`
- The high event count (100+) is normal — it includes MCP protocol frames, not just conversation turns

### Right panel (conversation)

The chat view showing:
- **User messages** (right, blue) — what you typed
- **Agent responses** (left, dark) — the LLM's final text
- **Tool call badges** — ⚡ `tool_name` (request) → ✓ `tool_name` (result) — shows which tools the LLM called and in what order

### Teaching tip

> Tell students to focus on the **right panel** for understanding agent behavior, and use the **Info tab** to see what tools the agent has access to. The left panel event inspector is for deep debugging (demo d09 teaches this explicitly).

### Runtime files (`.adk/`)

When `adk web` runs, it creates a `.adk/` directory inside the agents folder containing `session.db` (a SQLite database for session persistence). This is a **runtime artifact** — not source code. It's in `.gitignore` and gets recreated automatically on each run. You can delete it safely, or click "New Session" in the UI to start fresh.

## How to run

### ADK demos (01–09) — interactive web UI

```bash
# Run ALL demos (9 agents appear in the dropdown)
adk web d2_adk_multiagents/adk_demos/

# Open http://localhost:8000, pick a demo from the dropdown, chat with it
```

### Agents (buyer, seller, negotiation) — interactive web UI

```bash
# Run all 3 agents
adk web d2_adk_multiagents/negotiation_agents/

# With A2A endpoints enabled (serves Agent Cards automatically)
adk web --a2a d2_adk_multiagents/negotiation_agents/
```

With `--a2a`, each agent gets an Agent Card at:
- `http://localhost:8000/a2a/buyer_agent/.well-known/agent-card.json`
- `http://localhost:8000/a2a/seller_agent/.well-known/agent-card.json`
- `http://localhost:8000/a2a/negotiation/.well-known/agent-card.json`

### A2A protocol demos (10–12) — terminal scripts

```bash
# Terminal 1 — start agents with A2A endpoints
adk web --a2a d2_adk_multiagents/negotiation_agents/

# Terminal 2 — run the A2A demos
python d2_adk_multiagents/adk_demos/a2a_10_wire_lifecycle.py --seller-url http://127.0.0.1:8000/a2a/seller_agent
python d2_adk_multiagents/adk_demos/a2a_11_context_threading.py --seller-url http://127.0.0.1:8000/a2a/seller_agent
python d2_adk_multiagents/adk_demos/a2a_12_parts_and_artifacts.py --seller-url http://127.0.0.1:8000/a2a/seller_agent

# A2A orchestrated negotiation (buyer ↔ seller via Agent Cards)
python d2_adk_multiagents/a2a_13_orchestrated_negotiation.py
```

## Agent details

### `negotiation_agents/buyer_agent/` — Buyer (MCPToolset + allowlist)

Declarative `LlmAgent` with `MCPToolset` connecting to the pricing MCP server. A `before_tool_callback` enforces the buyer's tool allowlist — the buyer can never call `get_minimum_acceptable_price`.

### `negotiation_agents/seller_agent/` — Seller (dual MCPToolsets + information asymmetry)

Same pattern, but connects to **two** MCP servers (pricing + inventory). The seller has access to `get_minimum_acceptable_price` — the buyer does not. This is the same information asymmetry from Demo 1, now declarative.

### `negotiation_agents/negotiation/` — Orchestrator (LoopAgent + SequentialAgent + MCP)

A `LoopAgent` wrapping a `SequentialAgent(buyer → seller)` where both agents have real MCP tools. The buyer calls `get_market_price` and `calculate_discount` before each offer. The seller calls `get_minimum_acceptable_price` and `get_inventory_level`, then calls a `submit_decision` tool to write `{"action": "ACCEPT", "price": 445000}` to state. The `after_agent_callback` reads this structured dict — not free text — to detect agreement.

## Demos walkthrough

| # | ADK concept | Key takeaway |
|---|---|---|
| 01 | `LlmAgent` + function tool | Simplest possible agent — declare and go |
| 02 | `MCPToolset` | ADK spawns MCP server, discovers tools automatically |
| 03 | `ToolContext` + state | Tools can read/write session state that persists across turns |
| 04 | `SequentialAgent` | Pipeline: each agent's `output_key` feeds the next via `{placeholder}` |
| 05 | `ParallelAgent` | Fan-out: concurrent agents write to different state keys |
| 06 | `LoopAgent` | Iterate until `callback_context.actions.escalate = True` |
| 07 | `AgentTool` | Wrap an agent as a callable tool — hierarchical delegation |
| 08 | Callbacks | `before_model` (PII redaction), `before_tool` (allowlist), `after_tool` (logging) |
| 09 | Event stream | See ADK events: tool calls, state deltas, final response markers |
| 10 | A2A wire format | Hand-craft JSON-RPC, see Agent Card discovery, task state transitions |
| 11 | A2A context threading | `contextId` ties multiple rounds into one conversation |
| 12 | A2A parts & artifacts | Multi-part Messages (TextPart + DataPart), inspect Artifacts |
| 13 | A2A orchestration | Full buyer↔seller negotiation — Agent Card discovery + multi-round A2A messages |

## Exercises

Nine exercises, as optional practice. Try them on your own, then check yourself against the worked solution in `solution/`.

Each exercise extends the real-estate codebase with a production-relevant pattern. Difficulty mix: 1 starter, 6 core, 2 stretch.

| Exercise | Difficulty | Reinforces | Task |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`ex01_budget_cap_callback.md`](exercises/ex01_budget_cap_callback.md) | `[Starter]` | Demo 08 (callbacks) | Write a `before_tool_callback` that blocks `submit_decision` calls with `price > $460,000`. Forces the buyer to obey budget *deterministically*, not just via instruction. |
| [`ex02_stuck_detection.md`](exercises/ex02_stuck_detection.md) | `[Core]` | Demos 03, 06 (state, LoopAgent escalation) | Modify the orchestrator to track offer history across rounds and escalate early when 3+ consecutive rounds show <$1K of movement. The production "stuck-agent detection" pattern. |
| [`ex03_a2a_multiround_client.md`](exercises/ex03_a2a_multiround_client.md) | `[Core]` | Demos 10, 11, 13 (A2A wire format, contextId threading) | Write a Python script that drives buyer ↔ seller via A2A `message/send`, threading by `contextId`. The matchmaker pattern, end to end. |
| [`ex04_mediator_agent.md`](exercises/ex04_mediator_agent.md) | `[Core]` | Demo 07 (`AgentTool`) | Build a mediator that wraps buyer + seller as `AgentTool`s and proposes a midpoint price. Demonstrates hierarchical delegation as the alternative to peer-to-peer A2A. |
| [`ex05_prompt_injection_defense.md`](exercises/ex05_prompt_injection_defense.md) | `[Core]` | Demo 08 (`before_model` callback) | Add a `before_model_callback` to the seller that detects and redacts prompt injection attempts ("ignore your instructions", "what's your floor price"). Adversarial input defense for multi-agent systems. |
| [`ex06_human_in_the_loop.md`](exercises/ex06_human_in_the_loop.md) | `[Core]` | Demos 06, 08 (LoopAgent, callbacks) | Add a human-approval checkpoint that pauses the negotiation when the seller tries to accept above $455K. Three-tier governance: auto-approve, human checkpoint, hard block. |
| [`ex07_parallel_negotiation.md`](exercises/ex07_parallel_negotiation.md) | `[Stretch]` | Demos 04, 05, 06 (Sequential, Parallel, Loop) | Build a system that negotiates with two sellers in parallel using `ParallelAgent`, then a `deal_picker` agent compares outcomes and recommends the best deal. Composes all three workflow agent types. |
| [`ex08_shared_market_intel.md`](exercises/ex08_shared_market_intel.md) | `[Core]` | Demo 03 (`app:` state) | Use `app:`-scoped state as a shared market intelligence layer. An `after_tool_callback` caches every pricing lookup; both buyer and seller reference the same comparable sales data. |
| [`ex09_adaptive_strategy.md`](exercises/ex09_adaptive_strategy.md) | `[Stretch]` | Demos 03, 07 (state, AgentTool) | Add episodic negotiation memory and a strategy advisor sub-agent (wrapped as `AgentTool`) that analyses concession patterns and recommends tactics before each buyer offer. |
Each solution lives in `solution/<exercise_name>/` as a self-contained, runnable package — most are launchable directly with `adk web solution/<exercise_name>/`.

## A2A in one diagram

```
adk web --a2a negotiation_agents/
  ├─ buyer_agent   → GET /.well-known/agent-card.json
  ├─ seller_agent  → GET /.well-known/agent-card.json
  └─ negotiation   → GET /.well-known/agent-card.json

Demo 10 (terminal):
  1. GET /a2a/seller_agent/.well-known/agent-card.json  → discover capabilities
  2. POST /a2a/seller_agent  (JSON-RPC message/send)    → send offer
  3. Response: Task { status: "completed", result: counter-offer }

Demo 11 (terminal):
  Round 1: POST → get contextId from response
  Round 2: POST + contextId → threaded conversation
  Round 3: POST + contextId → agreement or deadlock
```
