Solution — Exercise 2: Multi-server LlmAgent
==============================================

A `property_advisor` agent that connects to BOTH the pricing server and
the inventory server simultaneously, exposing all four tools to GPT-4o.

This is the same pattern as `seller_agent/agent.py`, but written from
scratch — and without the `before_tool_callback` allowlist (so the
agent can use every tool from both servers).

To demo:

    adk web d2_adk_multiagents/adk_demos/property_advisor/
    # OR (when this folder is symlinked / copied to adk_demos/):
    adk web d2_adk_multiagents/adk_demos/

    Then pick `property_advisor` from the dropdown and ask:
      - "What's 742 Evergreen Terrace worth?"
      - "What's the seller's minimum?"
      - "Walk me through whether to make an offer."
